# Architecture Documentation

This section provides high-level architectural understanding of the Hatch package manager system.

## Overview

Hatch is a sophisticated package management system designed for the CrackingShells ecosystem, featuring modular architecture with clear separation of concerns across multiple layers.

## Available Documentation

### System Architecture

- **[System Overview](./system_overview.md)** - High-level introduction to Hatch's architecture and core concepts
- **[Component Architecture](./component_architecture.md)** - Detailed breakdown of major system components and their relationships

### Design Patterns

Design patterns are covered within the main architecture documents:

- **Installer Framework** - Strategy pattern implementation covered in [Component Architecture](./component_architecture.md#installation-system-components)
- **Environment Management** - Environment patterns covered in [Component Architecture](./component_architecture.md#environment-management-components)

## Architecture Diagram

The complete system architecture is documented in the [Architecture Diagram](../../resources/diagrams/architecture.puml), which provides a visual overview of all components and their relationships.

## Key Architectural Principles

1. **Modular Design** - Clear separation of concerns across components
2. **Extensibility** - Plugin-based architecture for installers and extensions
3. **Environment Isolation** - Robust environment management with metadata persistence
4. **Caching Strategy** - TTL-based caching for performance optimization

## For New Developers

If you're new to the Hatch codebase:

1. Start with [System Overview](./system_overview.md) to understand the big picture
2. Review the [Architecture Diagram](../../resources/diagrams/architecture.puml) for visual context
3. Explore [Component Architecture](./component_architecture.md) for detailed component understanding
4. Check [Implementation Guides](../implementation_guides/) when ready to work on specific features
