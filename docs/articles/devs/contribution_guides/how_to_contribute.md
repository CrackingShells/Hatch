# How to Contribute

This article is about:

- General contribution workflow and process for the Hatch project
- Branch naming conventions and submission requirements
- Community standards and expectations for contributors

## Overview

We welcome contributions to the Hatch project! This guide outlines the process for contributing code, documentation, and other improvements to help ensure smooth collaboration and high-quality contributions.

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Understand the System** - Review [Architecture Documentation](../architecture/) to understand Hatch's design
2. **Set Up Development Environment** - Follow [Development Environment Setup](../development_processes/development_environment_setup.md)
3. **Review Standards** - Familiarize yourself with [Testing Requirements](./testing_and_ci.md) and [Release Policies](./release_and_dependency_policy.md)

### Planning Your Contribution

- **Check Existing Issues** - Search [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/CrackingShells/Hatch/issues) for related work
- **Discuss Major Changes** - Open an issue to discuss significant changes before implementing
- **Review Implementation Guides** - Check [Implementation Guides](../implementation_guides/) for technical guidance

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
git fork https://github.com/CrackingShells/Hatch.git

# Clone your fork locally
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Hatch.git
cd Hatch

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/CrackingShells/Hatch.git
```

### 2. Create Feature Branch

Use descriptive branch names with appropriate prefixes:

```bash
# Feature additions
git checkout -b feat/add-new-installer-type

# Bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/environment-creation-error

# Documentation updates
git checkout -b docs/update-architecture-guide
```

**Branch Naming Conventions:**

- `feat/` - New features or enhancements
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `cicd/` - CI/CD pipeline changes

### 3. Implement Your Changes

#### Code Changes

- Follow the organization's coding standards
- Write clear, self-documenting code with appropriate comments
- Include docstrings following the organization's docstring standards
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging

#### Testing Requirements

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Follow the three-tier testing approach: Development, Regression, Feature
- Ensure tests pass locally before submitting
- Maintain or improve test coverage

#### Documentation Updates

- Update relevant documentation for new features
- Follow the organization's documentation guidelines
- Reference API docstrings rather than duplicating implementation details
- Maintain clear cross-references between related topics

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "[Update] Add support for custom installer types"
git commit -m "[Fix] Resolve environment creation race condition"
git commit -m "[Docs - Minor] Typos in installation orchestration guide"

# Include more detail in commit body for complex changes
git commit -m "[Feat] Implement parallel dependency installation

- Add ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent installations
- Implement dependency grouping for parallelization
- Add timeout handling for long-running installations
- Update tests to cover parallel execution scenarios"
```

### 5. Keep Your Branch Updated

```bash
# Fetch latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Rebase your branch on latest main
git rebase upstream/main

# Resolve any conflicts and continue
git rebase --continue
```

### 6. Submit Pull Request

#### Pull Request Guidelines
