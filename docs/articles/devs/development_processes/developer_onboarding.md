# Developer Onboarding

This article is about:

- Quick start guide for new developers joining the Hatch project
- Essential knowledge and resources for getting productive quickly
- Step-by-step onboarding process from setup to first contribution

## Welcome to Hatch Development

This guide will help you get up to speed quickly as a new developer on the Hatch package manager project. Follow this step-by-step process to understand the system and make your first contribution.

## Step 1: Understand What Hatch Is

### Project Overview

Hatch is a package management system designed for MCP server packages, environments, and registry interactions.

### Key Concepts

- **Environments** - Isolated spaces for package installations
- **Installers** - Modular components that handle different dependency types
- **Registry** - Remote package discovery and retrieval system
- **Orchestrator** - Coordinates multi-type dependency installation

## Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+ installed
- Conda or Mamba for Python environment management
- Git for version control
- Code editor
- Terminal/command line access

### Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CrackingShells/Hatch.git
cd Hatch

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Run basic tests to verify setup
python run_tests.py --integration

# Test CLI functionality
hatch --help
```

## Step 3: Explore the Codebase

### Start with High-Level Architecture

1. **Read** [System Overview](../architecture/system_overview.md) - Understand the big picture
2. **Review** [Architecture Diagram](../../resources/diagrams/architecture.puml) - Visual system layout
3. **Examine** [Component Architecture](../architecture/component_architecture.md) - Detailed component breakdown

### Key Files to Understand

```txt
hatch/
├── cli_hatch.py                    # Main CLI entry point
├── environment_manager.py          # Environment lifecycle management
├── package_loader.py              # Package loading and validation
├── registry_retriever.py          # Package downloads and caching
└── installers/                    # Installation system
    ├── dependency_installation_orchestrator.py
    ├── installer_base.py
    └── [specific installers]
```

### Explore by Running Examples

```bash
# Create a test environment
python -m hatch env create test-env

# List environments
python -m hatch env list

# Install a package (if available)
python -m hatch install example-package

# Clean up
python -m hatch env remove test-env
```

## Step 4: Understand the Development Workflow

### Testing Strategy

Hatch uses a three-tier testing approach:

- **Development tests** (`dev_test_*.py`) - Temporary validation during development
- **Regression tests** (`regression_test_*.py`) - Permanent tests preventing regressions
- **Feature tests** (`feature_test_*.py`) - Permanent tests for new features

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python run_tests.py

# Run specific test types
python run_tests.py --regression
python run_tests.py --feature

# Run tests for specific component
python run_tests.py --pattern "*environment*"
```

### Code Quality Standards

- Follow organization-wide Python coding standards
- Write comprehensive docstrings
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Include progress reporting for long-running operations

## Step 5: Make Your First Contribution

### Choose a Good First Issue

Look for issues labeled:

- `good first issue` - Beginner-friendly tasks
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `testing` - Test additions or improvements

### Simple Contribution Ideas

1. **Add a test case** - Find a component with incomplete test coverage
2. **Improve documentation** - Add examples or clarify existing docs
3. **Fix a small bug** - Look for simple bug reports
4. **Add error handling** - Improve error messages or edge case handling

### Follow the Contribution Process

1. **Create a branch** - Use descriptive naming compatible with automated versioning (`feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`)
2. **Make your changes** - Follow coding standards and include tests
3. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure all tests pass
4. **Submit a pull request** - Follow the [contribution guidelines](../contribution_guides/how_to_contribute.md)

## Step 6: Learn Advanced Topics

### As You Get More Comfortable

1. **Installer Framework** - Learn how to [add new installers](../implementation_guides/adding_installers.md)
2. **Orchestration System** - Understand [installation orchestration](../implementation_guides/installation_orchestration.md)
3. **Registry Integration** - Work with [registry systems](../implementation_guides/registry_integration.md)

### Community

- **GitHub Issues** - Bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions** - Questions and general discussion
- **Pull Request Reviews** - Learn from code review feedback

## Next Steps

### After Your First Contribution

1. **Reflect on the process** - What was easy? What was challenging?
2. **Identify areas of interest** - Which parts of the system interest you most?
3. **Take on larger tasks** - Gradually work on more complex features
4. **Help other new contributors** - Share your onboarding experience

### Becoming a Regular Contributor

1. **Specialize in an area** - Become an expert in specific components
2. **Review others' contributions** - Help with code reviews and testing
3. **Improve documentation** - Keep documentation current and helpful
4. **Mentor new developers** - Help onboard future contributors

Welcome to the Hatch development community! We're excited to have you contribute to making package management better for the CrackingShells ecosystem.
