# Phase 1: Extend Validator and Integrate with Hatch

**Goal:**  
Ensure the validator provides a simple, install-ready list of Hatch package dependencies (including `resolved_version`), and refactor Hatch to use this output. Address and fix the API breakage caused by recent validator changes.

---

### Action 1.1: Extend the validator to output install-ready Hatch dependencies

- **Preconditions:**  
  - Existing validator logic for dependency validation and graph traversal.
  - Only Hatch dependencies are relevant for this step.

- **Details:**  
  - Add or extend a method in `HatchPackageValidator` (or a related utility) to return a list of Hatch package dependencies for a given package, in install order (topologically sorted, acyclic).
  - Each dependency object should include:
    - `name`
    - `version_constraint`
    - `resolved_version` (mandatory, to facilitate downstream installation)
  - Use or adapt logic from `version_utils.py` and `package_validator.py` to avoid duplicating dependency parsing or graph traversal.
  - Do **not** include external dependency types in this output; those will be handled by their respective managers.

- **Context**:
  - Files:
    - package_validator.py
    - dependency_graph.py
    - version_utils.py
    - validator.py
  - Symbols:
    - `HatchPackageValidator`
    - `DependencyGraph`
    - Any new method like `get_hatch_dependencies_in_install_order`

- **Postconditions:**  
  - Validator can output a simple, install-ready list of Hatch package dependencies (with `resolved_version`) for a given package.

- **Validation:**
  - **Development tests:** Integration tests using dummy packages to verify correct dependency order, content, and resolved versions.
  - **Verification method:** Compare output to expected install order for known test cases.

---

### Action 1.2: Refactor Hatch to delegate all dependency resolution to the validator and fix API breakage

- **Preconditions:**  
  - Validator provides a method for retrieving install-ready Hatch dependencies (with `resolved_version`).
  - Hatch currently has broken integration due to missing/changed attributes in the validator.

- **Details:**  
  - Refactor Hatch to use the new validator method for all Hatch dependency resolution.
  - Remove any direct access to `dependency_resolver` or other internals that no longer exist in `HatchPackageValidator`.
  - Update all relevant code paths in Hatch (especially in `environment_manager.py`) to use the new API.
  - Ensure that the new integration is robust to future validator changes by relying only on documented, stable APIs.
  - Add or update error handling to provide clear messages if the validator cannot resolve dependencies.

- **Context**:
  - Files:
    - environment_manager.py
    - package_loader.py
    - cli_hatch.py
    - package_validator.py
  - Symbols:
    - `HatchEnvironmentManager`
    - `HatchPackageValidator`
    - Any new/updated method for dependency resolution

- **Postconditions:**  
  - Hatch no longer relies on removed or internal attributes of the validator.
  - All dependency resolution for Hatch packages is delegated to the validator via a stable, public API.
  - The integration is robust and future-proof.

- **Validation:**
  - **Development tests:** Reuse or enhance `test_env_manip.py` to cover package installation, environment creation, and dependency resolution.
  - **Verification method:** Run Hatch end-to-end and confirm no AttributeError or similar integration failures.

---

### Phase 1 Completion Criteria

- Validator provides a simple, install-ready list of Hatch dependencies (with `resolved_version`).
- Hatch uses only the validator for Hatch dependency resolution, with no broken or deprecated API usage.
- All integration and regression tests pass for both validator and Hatch.
